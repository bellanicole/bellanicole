my birthday is on november 22
purple is my favorite color
I love ice cream and pizza
I don't like being yelled at
I don't have a crush at school
I love apples
I'm attracted to tall men
I also like the ones with abs
My height is 5'6?
I want to receive a gift
I haven't received flowers yet
no one has seriously flirted with me yet
I quickly get tired of men
I don't want someone touching my face
I like to cook pancakes
I like the guy with the motorcycle
I like the one with table manners
I hate liars the most
If you want me, you should only want me
physical touch makes me weak
What I like in a man is the gentle one
I don't like fish
I like to wear a dress
My foot size is 42 huhu
my waist is 27
does anyone like me?
I just want to feel loved
it's hard to speak english
invite me to play ml
I also play 'play together'
I like to look at the sky whenever I'm stressed
suggest some of you playlist from spotify
I'm always getting hurt, because I'm so flirtatious that I don't get hurt anymore?
I have a lot more to say but that's all for now
